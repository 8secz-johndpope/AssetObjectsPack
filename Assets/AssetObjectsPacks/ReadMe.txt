Asset Objects Packs:

a framework for dealing with large asset sets

includes a few scripts to get set up with a large animation set from mixamo


To create a new asset set:
    1.  make a directory in the AssetObjectsPacks/Packs/ folder (the name of the folder will be the pack name)
    
    2.  create a directory in the pack folder called "AssetObjects".
        This is the directory where you will put all the assets 
        to pick from (Audio clips, animations, etc...) for this pack
    


    3.  in the pack drectory, create a AssetObjectPackConfiguration object
        
        (right click -> AssetObjectsPacks -> PackConfiguration)
        
        then set up the file extensions the pack uses


    todo: 
        (make menu)
        AssetObjects, Holder, Behaviors, and Users





        instructions for asset object runtime representation Objects
        holder (like cue)
            trigger object (user )
            user = animator or audio source

            instructions for editors for those objects (for explorer)
