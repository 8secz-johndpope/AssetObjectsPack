Mixamo Auto Download Instuctions:

    NOTE: these instructions are only tested on chrome

    1.  change chrome's default download folder to a new folder

    1.  go to mixamo.com and log in 
    
    2.  for the avatar defenition download the ybot character and import it into Unity
        make sure to set the rig on the model as humanoid

        NOTE:
            if for some reason you want to change the default avatar defenition for the animations
            remember to change the name in the javascript file, change the character const near the top of the file.
            to get the new id, download an animation with the new character. 
            the id should show up in the network tab

    3.  go to the main animations page

    4.  open the chrome console and paste the contents of mixamo_downloader.js

    5.  press enter and wait, (it will take a while, there are over 7,000 animations with all the variations)

    6.  when the downloads are done, open the command line (or terminal) and cd into the download directory

    7.  copy and paste the following into the command line to rename all the files:
         
            find . -type f -name "ybot@-*" \
            -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0/ybot@-/@ID-}"' '{}' \;

        (normally the asset object event editor will do this automatically, 
        but it's faster for the command line to rename all these animations)

    8.  when the downloads are done being renamed import them into Unity.
    
        importing might take a while as well (it's best to do this in batches)
