Mixamo Auto Download Instuctions:

    NOTE: these instructions are only tested on chrome


    1.  change chrome's default download folder to a new folder

    1.  go to mixamo.com and log in 
    
    2.  for the avatar defenition download the ybot character
        import the downloaded model to the AssetObjectsPacks root directory (in Unity)
        (you can move it after the animations are imported)

        NOTE:
            if for some reason you want to change the default avatar defenition for the animations
            remember to change the name in:
                AnimationsDownload/Editor/AnimationsDownloadUtils.cs
                
            in the javascript file, change the character const near the top of the file.
            to get the new id, download an animation with the new character. the id should show up in the network tab

    3.  go to the main animations page

    4.  open the chrome console and paste the contents of mixamo_downloader.js

    5.  press enter and wait, (it will take a while, there are over 7,000 animations with all the variations)

    6.  when the downloads are done import them into:
            Assets/AssetObjectsPacks/Packs/Animations/AssetObjects/

        importing might take a while as well (it's best to do this in batches)
        they'll automatically be set to humanoid,
        with an avatar defenition from the imported model from step 2
        the animations will also be renamed with valid ids
